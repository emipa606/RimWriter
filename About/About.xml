--- Original Description ---
Add tablets, books, scrolls, libraries, and more to your RimWorld playthroughs.

RimWriter is a mod that adds a lot of content focused on writing to supplement the standard vanilla RimWorld playthrough such as:

-Items
* Stone Tablets
* Leather Scrolls
* Journals
* Handwritten Books
* Typed Books and Journals
* Skillbooks for improving skills

-Furniture
* Stone shelves for tablets
* Scrollcases, tall and short
* Bookcases, tall and short
* Writer's tables
* A typewriter

-Features
* Customized text generation for tablets, books, and journals.
* Compatiblity with Lord of the Rims and Call of Cthulhu mods.
- In Call of Cthulhu, writing reduces sanity loss over time.
- Future compatability with storing Grimoires and Wizard textbooks inside bookcases/scrollcases.

Q and A:
Why create this mod?
I wanted to make a framework sort of mod that I could add to or use later in my current and future projects. I feel that tablets, scrolls, and books all have a clear place in RimWorld and future mods.

Is this mod old save compatible?
Yes.

Does this mod conflict with other joy mods?
No.</description>
